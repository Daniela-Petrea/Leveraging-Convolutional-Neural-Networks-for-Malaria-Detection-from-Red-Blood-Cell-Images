# Leveraging-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Malaria-Detection-from-Red-Blood-Cell-Images

This repository contains the code and resources for the research project named "Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks for Malaria Detection from Red Blood Cell Images" that is focused on malaria classification using deep learning techniques. 
The project aims to automate the diagnosis of malaria by analyzing segmented blood cell images obtained from the NIH database.
